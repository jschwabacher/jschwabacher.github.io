### Previously:
My primary body of research was for my Ph.D. thesis--[The Effects of Phase Transfers with Thiol Ligands on the Optical Properties of Water-Soluble Quantum Dots](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2447534194). My primary manuscript describes [the origin of the pH dependence of the emission of an aqueous quantum dot system](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b03619). (*Hitting a paywall? The full-text may be avialble [here](https://pubs.acs.org/articlesonrequest/AOR-vUemTZcSjtWyQRe658gU),* via *ACS Articles on Request.*)

I also contributed to ["An introduction to ratchets in chemistry and biology"](https://doi.org/10.1039/C7MH00062F) and ["Properties of Quantum Dots Coupled to Plasmons and Optical Cavities"](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5124392).

Other research experience includes immunological clinical trials, aqueous quantum dot syntheses, [nanoparticle-protein interactions in biological environments](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.biomac.6b01503), [biomaterials for wastewater treatment](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poly.2021.115297), [protein-based gold nanoparticle syntheses](https://doi.org/10.1039/C7DT03275G), polymer synthesis for drug delivery, and antimicrobial compound synthesis.
