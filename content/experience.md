### Hi, I'm a scientist based in Chicago, IL.

As a Senior Consultant at Beghou Consulting, I work on cross-functional teams to guide clients in the Life Sciences industry through the intricacies of the health care marketplace. I leverage skills as a data scientist to generate actionable insights by synthesizing, managing, and analyzing patient- and physician-level data. I also design and curate experiences for users of Beghou's proprietary technology. With all projects, I apply a broad frame of reference while balancing what is doable with what is actually worth doing to ensure consistent quality. I have a passion for quickly learning new information and communicating evidence-based solutions to audiences of all backgrounds. In alignment with my scientific training, I remain open to new information and am willing to adjust recommendations based on newly acquired data.

### Background.
My love of science education quietly revealed itself to me while I led my classmates through an AP Chemistry solutions set in high school. I had always been interested in science, which provides my innate curiosity with an outlet, but I had not expected to find fulfillment in teaching others. I discovered that I could satisfy my otherwise insatiable desire for growth by helping others grow in their understanding of themselves and the universe. I followed the subtle pulls of curiosity and growth to Northwestern University, where I was a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow.

### Scientific Research.
My [research](/research) focused on water-soluble nanoparticles, which may be used for medical imaging or biological sensing.

### Teaching and education.
Outside the lab, I was immersed in improving classrooms via scientific inquiry through the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning. This took many forms, such as completing and presenting a [Teaching-As-Research experiment](/teaching/teaching-as-research), or developing new curricula. I also worked with colleagues to design/conduct [teaching assistant training workshops](/teaching/training-gtas), advocate for evidenced-based changes to existing undergraduate curricula, and support a departmental commitment to pedagogy.

### Leadership and service.
I served my department and academic community by creating opportunities for growth and leading discussions with multiple stakeholders. I co-founded [Chemistry Graduate Student Teachers](/leadership), a graduate student group focused on science education and graduate student professional development, to build a space for learning how to teach within Northwestern's Chemistry Department. I was also the treasurer of the [Graduate Liaison Committee](/leadership), which brings together other student organizations, staff, and faculty to improve the graduate student experience in the Chemistry Department.

### Engagement and communication.
I am devoted to [making science accessible](/engagement) to everyone. This endeavor has manifested in a myriad of ways, including participating in amateur stand-up comedy through Science Riot presented by the Chicago Council of Science and Technology. I have also enjoyed teaching societyâ€™s youngest scientists through a variety of after school science education programs for local K-12 students.
